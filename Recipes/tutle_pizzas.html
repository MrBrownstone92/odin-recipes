    <p><strong>Four Cheese Pizza Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pizza Dough</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling and
        greasing
      </li>
      <li>1 large garlic clove, pressed or grated</li>
      <li>Fine sea salt and ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
      <li>1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. In a small bowl, stir <br />
        together the olive oil and garlic. Set aside to marinate for 15
        minutes.<br />
        Stretch or roll the dough into a 12-inch disk and place it on the
        pizza<br />
        stone or pan. Brush the dough all over with some of the garlic oil,<br />
        making sure to get it all the way to the edges. Season with salt and<br />
        pepper, scatter on the mozzarella and jack cheeses, dot all over with<br />
        ricotta, and sprinkle the Parmesan over the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the pizza for 8 to 15 minutes until the crust is golden brown
        and<br />
        the cheese is beginning to blister in spots. With a few minutes<br />
        remaining, sprinkle the pizza with the parsley. Remove the pizza from<br />
        the oven. Let it cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.<br />
