    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>2 courgettes, cut into 1cm batons</li>
      <li>oil, for deep frying</li>
      <li>15g parmesan, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Tip the flour into a bowl, drizzle in 2 tbsp water and mix to form a
        thick batter. <br />Season with plenty of salt and freshly ground black
        pepper, then mix in the courgettes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour oil into a pan until it is about 4cm deep, ensuring the pan is no
        more than two thirds full. Set over a medium heat until 180C or a flick
        of batter dropped in sizzles and turns brown within 30 seconds.<br />
        Lower half the battered courgettes into the hot oil and fry, turning
        after 1 min using a slotted spoon, for 5-6 mins until golden. If they
        begin to stick together, gently coax them apart with tongs.<br />Remove
        from the hot oil and drain on a plate lined with a sheet of kitchen
        paper. Repeat with the remaining half, then scatter with the parmesan
        before serving.
      </li>
      <p><strong>Recipe Tip</strong></p>
      <p>
        If you have any courgette flowers, they work well in salads or try them
        stuffed with seasoned soft cheese, lightly battered and deep-fried.
